    <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Beacon plugins are implemented with JavaScript and CSS. Anytime you are using code you want to consider code organization. In the <a href="/ott-plugins/learning-guide-beacon-plugins.html">Learning Guide: Beacon Plugins</a> document you learned that one JavaScript file is pointed to that is loaded into your Beacon web app. That single file, named <strong>index.js</strong> could hold all your Beacon plugin JavaScript code, but this would lead to poor coding practices. Also, there are a myriad of other JavaScript frameworks from which you could choose. For a balance between poor practices and too much complexity, the documents around Beacon plugins use JavaScript modules for code organization.</p>
    <p>Basically the <strong>index.js</strong> will act as a "controller" and the actual implementation details for each plugin element will be in a JavaScript module file. Of course, you are able to use your favorite JavaScript framework for your implementation code.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--tip language-editable">Event dispatching and handling code is used in the examples shown below. The document <a href="/ott-plugins/dispatching-handling-events.html">Dispatching and Handling Events in Beacon Plugins</a> explains the details of events in Beacon plugins, and is considered a pre-requisite to this document.</aside>

    <h2 id="The_modules">The modules</h2>
    <p>It is consider good coding practices to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Not duplicate code</li>
      <li>Make your code as reusable as possible</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Using modules will help us accomplish both of these tasks. First, let's take a look at the basic syntax of how modules will be structured in the example shown in these docs:</p>

    <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-javascript" translate="No">const function1 = () => { 
  code;
  code;
  code;
  code;
};
  
const function2 = () => {
  code;
  code;
  code;
  code;
};

const function3 = () => {
  code;
  code;
  code;
  code;
};
  
export { function1, function2, functions3 };</code></pre>
    <p>You see three functions defined as constants using arrow notation. This functions will perform tasks like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a button</li>
      <li>Open the side panel</li>
      <li>Place content in a custom div</li>
      <li>Contain the code for a button click handler</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The functions will be imported into our "controller", for Beacon plugins the file <strong>index.js</strong>, then used as necessary.</p>
    <p>Here is a simple module that contains a function that creates a button.</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-javascript" translate="No">const addCustomButtonDetails = () => {
    
  window.postMessage({
    event: 'detailsPageAddCustomButton',
    data: {
      title: 'Test Button',
      font_awesome_icon: 'fa fa-info-circle',
      element_id: 'TEST_BTN_ID'
    }
  }, window.location.origin);
  
};
  
export { addCustomButtonDetails };</code></pre>
    <p>This will function properly, but is not reusable. You will need a different function for every button you wish to create. To make the function reusable parameters are used:</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-javascript" translate="No">const addCustomButtonDetails = (pTitle, pIcon, pID) => {
  
  window.postMessage({
    event: 'detailsPageAddCustomButton',
    data: {
      title: pTitle,
      font_awesome_icon: pIcon,
      element_id: pID
    }
  }, window.location.origin);

};

export { addCustomButtonDetails };</code></pre>
    <p>If there are buttons, there should be click handlers. A function is added to the module that is called on a button click and simply pops up an alert with the name of the button in it. Actually handling the event is left to the controller</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-javascript" translate="No">const addCustomButtonDetails = (pTitle, pIcon, pID) => {
      
  window.postMessage({
    event: 'detailsPageAddCustomButton',
    data: {
      title: pTitle,
      font_awesome_icon: pIcon,
      element_id: pID
    }
  }, window.location.origin);

};

const handleButtonClick = (buttonString) => {

  alert('button was clicked ' + buttonString);

};

export { addCustomButtonDetails, handleButtonClick };</code></pre>
    <p>Now it is time to move on to see how the functions can be used.</p>
