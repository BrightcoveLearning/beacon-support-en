    <p>Beacon plugins are implemented with JavaScript and CSS. Anytime you are using code you want to consider code organization. In the <a href="/ott-plugins/learning-guide-beacon-plugins.html">Learning Guide: Beacon Plugins</a> document you learned that one JavaScript file is pointed to that is loaded into your Beacon web app. That single file, named <strong>index.js</strong> could hold all your Beacon plugin JavaScript code, but this would lead to poor coding practices. Also, there are a myriad of other JavaScript frameworks from which you could choose. For a balance between poor practices and too much complexity, the documents around Beacon plugins use JavaScript modules for code organization.</p>
    <p>Basically the <strong>index.js</strong> will act as a "controller" and the actual implementation details for each plugin element will be in a JavaScript module file. Of course, you are able to use your favorite JavaScript framework for you implementation code.</p>

    <p>It is consider good coding practices to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Not duplicate code</li>
      <li>Make your code as reusable as possible</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Using modules will help us accomplish both of these tasks. First, let's take a look at the basic syntax of how modules will be structured in the example shown in these docs:</p>
