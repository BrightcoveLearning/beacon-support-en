		<dl>
			<dt>Business Unit</dt>
			<dd>A Business Unit (BU) is an entity in Evergent’s system that defines a country or region where you would like to sell your content. You will need separate Business Units if you want different currencies or tax collection per country/region. In Evergent’s system each Business Unit will have a currency assigned to it, this currency is what will be presented to their users when they checkout.</dd>
			<dt>Payment Gateway</dt>
			<dd>A service that allows a merchant to accept payments from customers. The payment gateway acts as a middleman by moving the money from the bank accounts of your customers to your own bank account in a secure and reliable way. </dd>
			<dt>Merchant of Record</dt>
			<dd>The legal entity that is authorized to receive payments from consumers. You be the MOR (Merchant of Record) with each gateway that you use.</dd>
			<dt>Merchant Account</dt>
			<dd>A virtual bank account where revenue from online sales is sent. Revenue resides in your merchant account until settlement — the process of transferring funds to your bank account. Typically the payment gateway provides a merchant account. Gateways that do not provide merchant accounts transfer funds directly to your bank account.</dd>
			<dt>Package</dt>

		<p>Once Packages and Products are configured, a customer will be able to accept payments on their Beacon Web app. Purchases in the Beacon web app are processed through a payment gateway connected through the Evergent platform.</p>
		<h3>Payment Gateways and Payment methods</h3>
		<p>Evergent allows our customers to receive payments through multiple payment gateways. The payment gateway configuration is at the Business Unit level. A customer can have multiple payment gateways configured to a Business Unit. When multiple gateways are configured, the viewer has different payment method options when checking out. Customers are required to have a relationship directly with the payment gateway.</p>
