    <p>Beacon plugins provide customization of your web apps not available through the normal page creation process in Beacon Studio. For instance, this 8 second video shows the side panel opening and closing under viewer control. What, where, how, why</p>
    <div style="position: relative; display: block; max-width: 960px;">
      <div style="padding-top: 56.25%;"><iframe src="https://players.brightcove.net/1752604059001/default_default/index.html?videoId=1722964957659610162" allowfullscreen="" allow="encrypted-media" style="position: absolute; top: 0px; right: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    </div>
    <p>This side panel can be populated with data about the video playing, or maybe if it is a live video you can place a chat application in the side panel for viewer comments and discussion. The side panel is just one element available only through Beacon plugins.</p>
    <p>The plugin functionality is controlled with JavaScript and CSS. In Beacon Classic you point to one JavaScript file and one CSS file that are loaded at app startup. Here is a screenshot of Beacon Classic of where that data is entered:</p>

    <p>The JavaScript file must be called <strong>index.js</strong> and the optional CSS file must be called <strong>index.css</strong>.</p>
