    <p>App users create their accounts when they first use a Brightcove Beacon app. These app users can also add new users. And if users no longer need it, these accounts can be deleted.</p>
    <p>The account adding and deletion functionality is supported in the following platforms: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mobile (iOS and Android)</li>
        <li>AppleTV </li>
        <li>SmartTV (AndroidTV, FireTV, LG, Samsung)</li>
      </ul>    
      <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">When a user successfully deletes their account in their app, an automated email is sent to the customerâ€™s configured email address containing the user information. The email is sent from <strong>apps@brightcove.com</strong>.  </aside>
    <p>When deleting, you have two options, those being:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Delete</li>
      <li>Delete and Forget</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you <strong>Delete</strong>, you can later restore the user from a deleted user list. When you <strong>Delete and Forget</strong> you have no chance to restore that user.
