    <p>Beacon plugins allow you to customize your web apps in ways that are not available through the normal page creation process in Beacon Studio. This short video shows a Beacon plugin that was created to display a panel that can be opened and closed by a viewer.</p>
    <div style="position: relative; display: block; max-width: 960px;">
      <div style="padding-top: 56.25%;"><iframe src="https://players.brightcove.net/1752604059001/default_default/index.html?videoId=1722964957659610162" allowfullscreen="" allow="encrypted-media" style="position: absolute; top: 0px; right: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    </div>
    <p>This side panel can be populated with data about the video playing, or if it is a live video, you can place a chat application in the side panel for viewer comments and discussion. The side panel is just one example of the types of elements that can be added only using Beacon plugins.</p>
    <p>The plugin functionality is controlled with JavaScript and CSS. <em>This means that to implement Beacon plugins some experience with JavaScript and CSS is required.</em></p>
    <p>The plugin code is read in by your Beacon web app. In Beacon Classic, you point to one JavaScript file and one CSS file that are loaded at app startup. Here is a screenshot where the data is entered in Beacon Classic:</p>

    <p>The files must be located at a publicly addressable URL and be named as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The JavaScript file must be called <strong>index.js</strong></li>
      <li>The optional CSS file must be called <strong>index.css</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="Implementation_architecture">Implementation architecture</h2>
    <p>As mentioned earlier, Beacon Plugins are implemented with JavaScript and CSS. Obviously, there are many ways to structure your JavaScript code. For instance:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You could simply put all your code the single <strong>index.js</strong> file mentioned earlier.</li>
      <li>Brightcove's consulting team did an implementation of the plugins using <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For the documents on this site, it was decided that the one file approach would lead to poor coding practices. React was maybe more than what was needed when the exact JavaScript skill sets of Beacon customers is not known. This led to the decision to use JavaScript modules for implementation and examples in this documentation.</p>
    <p>The <a href="/ott-plugins/using-javascript-modules.html">Using JavaScript Modules for Beacon Plugins</a> document explains the basic programming model around Beacon Plugins, and how JavaScript modules can be used for code implementation.</p>
    <p>Of course, you are free to organize your JavaScript code in any way you wish.</p>
