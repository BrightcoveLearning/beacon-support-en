        <h2 id="Syncing_options">Syncing options</h2>
        <p>In the <strong>Tools</strong> section of Brightcove Beacon you have two options for syncing Brightcove Beacon with the Video Cloud catalog. To get to the tools, click on the <strong>wrench</strong> icon in the top menu, then the <strong>Ingestion</strong> option on the left menu:</p>

            <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/syncing-with-vc/force-sync.png" alt="force-sync">
            <p>Here you have two tools with which to direct a sync. They are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Update Brightcove Videos</strong>: If you have added videos to your Video Cloud catalog, or altered existing videos, this button syncs the newly added or updated videos to Brightcove Beacon.</li>
                <li><strong>Update Brightcove Playlists</strong>: If you have added playlists to your Video Cloud catalog, or altered existing playlists, this button syncs the newly added or updated playlists to Brightcove Beacon.</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--warning">Note: Be sure to sync the videos first and wait for that process to end <strong>BEFORE</strong> syncing the playlists.</aside>

            </figure>
            <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--tip">When working with Brightcove personnel to configure your Brightcove Beacon Experience, you can request a schedule be created to automate the sync process.</aside>

        <h2 id="Clearing_the_cache_after_syncing">Clearing the cache after syncing</h2>
        <p>After syncing the videos you will most likely want to clear the cache to see the results of performing a sync as soon as possible. This can be done from the <strong>Tools</strong> menu. Simply click the <strong>Cache</strong> option from the left navigation and click the <strong>Cache Purge</strong> button. Note that doing this too frequently in production has an adverse effect on scalability and performance.
