    <p>Consider when an in-app purchases is done through a Brightcove Beacon app. The app communicates with one of the platform stores, like the Apple App Store, to complete the purchase. By default the supplier of the video content, and possibly other merchandise, purchased is not notified. It is necessary for the provider of the video content and/or merchandise to setup an endpoint so Brightcove Beacon can notify the provider a purchase was completed.</p>
    <p>An example, using the fictional company Acme Symphony which has setup an endpoint, of a in-app purchase through an iOS Beacon app is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A viewer purchases a subscription for access to videos of past symphonies, and tickets for the summer season of live concerts.</li>
      <li>The Beacon app completes the purchase through the Apple App Store.</li>
      <li>The Beacon app notifies Beacon of the purchase.</li>
      <li>The Beacon entitlement subsystem grants the viewer access all video assets in the purchased subscription.</li>
      <li>A notification is sent to Acme Symphony's endpoint.</li>
      <li>Acme Symphony knows of the purchase and sends tickets to the purchaser.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a managed service that provides message delivery from publishers to subscribers. For full details see Amazon's <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/welcome.html">SNS Developer Guide</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="Notification_specifications">Notification specifications</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Notifications of In App purchases from following stores is supported:
        <ul>
          <li>Apple App Store (iOS and AppleTV)</li>
          <li>Google Play (Android and Android TV)</li>
          <li>Roku Channel Store</li>
          <li>Amazon Appstore (FireTV)</li>
          <li>Stripe (Web and Samsung TV)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Beacon will report all purchase related events, including the following actions on subscriptions:
        <ul>
          <li>New</li>
          <li>Renewals</li>
          <li>Cancellations</li>
          <li>Pauses</li>
          <li>Holds</li>
          <li>Resumes</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Enough information is provided in the notification so the seller's external system is able to apply entitlements and/or prevent purchases of the same asset (subscription) if already purchased through Beacon or native stores.</li>
      <li>Purchase events are delivered to external stores within 5 min after receiving notification from source stores.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="API_endpoint">API endpoint</h2>
    <p>After successfully processing a subscription in the Beacon system, Beacon will deliver an SNS topic message to a configured API endpoint specific for a particular customer.</p>
    <p>Following are the requirements for the external end point:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The API endpoint must be compatible with AWS SNS integration. See Amazon's <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-http-https-endpoint-as-subscriber.html">Fanout to HTTP/S endpoints</a> document for more details. This document contains a link to an implementation of an endpoint that processes Amazon SNS HTTP POST requests, written as a Java servlet.</li>
      <li>The API endpoint will go through a subscription confirmation step. See Amazon's <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/SendMessageToHttp.confirm.html">Confirm the subscription</a> document for more details.</li>
      <li>The API endpoint will need to unescape the JSON in the message field of the notification. See Amazon's <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-message-and-json-formats.html">Parsing message formats</a> document for more details.</li>
      <li>The API endpoint must verify the signature and provenance of the message. See Amazon's <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-verify-signature-of-message.html">Verifying the signatures of Amazon SNS messages</a> document for more detials.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To be able to recover from errors, it is possible to re-send all purchases for a user (filtering any non active notifications). The store's external API endpoint is responsible for re-processing all messages, even if those were previously consumed.</p>
