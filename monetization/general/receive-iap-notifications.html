    <p>There are two types of purchases that can be done with Beacon, those being:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Purchases done outside Beacon - For those purchases a webhook/API is supported that allows external systems to notify Beacon of any purchases related events. This enables the Beacon entitlement subsystem to properly make assets available to viewers.</li>
      <li>Purchases executed through Beacon - Of course, the Beacon entitlement subsystem still makes assets available to viewers. Also available are notifications that are sent to the seller of the asset. This permits the asset supplier to display to the purchaser, via the external store, that a purchase has been made.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>An example of a purchase through Beacon is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A viewer purchases a subscription from ?????.</li>
      <li>The Beacon entitlement subsystem grants the viewer to access all video assets in the subscription.</li>
      <li>A notification is sent to ??????</li>
      <li>????? then uses the information in the notification to display to the viewer the subscription was purchased.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Notifications of In App purchases from following stores will be supported:
        <ul>
          <li>Apple store (iOS and AppleTV)</li>
          <li>Google Play (Android and Android TV)</li>
          <li>Roku store</li>
          <li>Amazon store (FireTV)</li>
          <li>Stripe (Web and Samsung TV)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Beacon will report all purchase related events, including the following actions on subscriptions:
        <ul>
          <li>New</li>
          <li>Renewals</li>
          <li>Cancellations</li>
          <li>Pauses</li>
          <li>Holds</li>
          <li>Resumes</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Enough information is provided in the notification so the seller's external system is able to apply entitlements and/or prevent purchases of same asset (subscription) if already purchased through Beacon or native stores.</li>
      <li>Purchase events are delivered to external stores within 5 min after receiving notification from source stores.</li>
      <li></li>
    </ul>
