  <summary>In this topic, you will learn the functionality of the options in the
    <strong>Tools</strong> section of Brightcove Beacon.

    <h2 id="Tools">Introducing the Tools</h2>
    <p>
      In Brightcove Beacon the <strong>wrench</strong> icon (labeled 1)
      represents a set of tools. The options for the tools are
      <strong>Ingestion</strong> and <strong>Cache</strong> (2). This document
      explores the two options.

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Ingestion">Ingestion</h2>
    <p>In the Ingestion group you have three tools:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Update Brightcove Videos</strong>: If you have added videos to
        your Video Cloud catalog, or altered existing videos, this button syncs
        the newly added or updated videos to Brightcove Beacon.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Update Brightcove Playlists</strong>: If you have added
        playlists to your Video Cloud catalog, or altered existing playlists,
        this button syncs the newly added or updated playlists to Brightcove
        Beacon.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>XML EPG - Fetch XML from Folder</strong>: When your EPG
        (Electronic Program Guide) needs to be updated, this button retrieves
        the updated XML file. You will be provided an S3 account in which to
        drop the file.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--tip">
      You can also work with Brightcove support personnel to create a schedule
      to automatically perform ingestion.

    <h3>Caveats for ingestion</h3>
    <p>
      Note that not all data that is entered about a particular video in Studio
      is automatically ingested into Brightcove Beacon. For instance, the
      following are not ingested into Brightcove Beacon from Video Cloud:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Availability times</strong>: Scheduling times set in the
        <em>AVAILABILITY</em> section of the video's properties are not ingested
        into Brightcove Beacon. The dates will be, but not the times.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Geo Filtering</strong>: Geo filtering information set in the
        <em>AVAILABILITY</em> section of the video's properties are not ingested
        into Brightcove Beacon.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--tip">
      The issues listed above can be remedied by creating a
      <strong>Package</strong> in Brightcove Beacon the assigning the video to
      that package at ingestion via custom fields. See the
      <a href="/using-brightcove-beacon/creating-svod-plan.html">Creating an SVOD Plan
      </a>
      and
      <a href="/using-brightcove-beacon/using-svod-plan.html">Using an SVOD Plan
      </a>
      documents for further information.
    </aside>
    <p>
      Also note that not every field mentioned in Brightcove Beacon has an
      associated custom field. For instance
      <em>Production Country</em> and <em>Sub-Genre</em> do not have
      corresponding custom fields associated with them.

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Cache">Cache</h2>
    <p>In the Cache group you have two tools:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Cache Purge</strong>: When you make changes in Brightcove
        Beacon, click this button to roll those changes into the current
        configuration. This option pulls all changes EXCEPT images into the
        current configuration.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Image Cache</strong>: If you update any images in Brightcove
        Beacon, click this button to roll the image changes into the current
        configuration.
      </li>
    </ul>

    </figure>
    <p>This process should not be done indiscriminately as doing this too frequently in production has an adverse effect on scalability and performance.</p>
