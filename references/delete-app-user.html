    <p>App users create their own accounts when they first use a Brightcove Beacon app. You delete users using Beacon Classic when the app users are no longer needed.</p>
    <p>When deleting, you have two options, those being:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Delete</li>
      <li>Delete and Forget</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you <strong>Delete</strong>, you can later restore the user from a deleted user list. When you <strong>Delete and Forget</strong> you have no chance to restore that user.</p>

    <p>Follow these steps to delete the user:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li>Log in to Beacon Classic.</li>
      <li>Navigate to <strong>App Users</strong> by following these steps:
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Click <strong>Commerce</strong> in the top navigation.</li>
          <li>Click <strong>App Users</strong> in the left navigation.</li>
        </ol>
        <figure class="bcls-figure">
          <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/references/delete-app-user/app-users-index.png" alt="app users index">
        </figure>
      </li>
      <li>Click the checkbox in front of the user you wish to delete to activate the <strong>Delete</strong> and <strong>Delete and Forget</strong> buttons.
        <figure class="bcls-figure">

        </figure>
      </li>
      <li>Now you have two options for user deletion:
        <ul>
          <li>Click <strong>Delete</strong> - Deletes user with the option to later restore the user.</li>
          <li>Click <strong>Delete and Forget</strong> - Deletes the user with no chance to restore, but a confirmation will be shown.</li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Note: If you select more than one user you will only be able to <strong>Delete</strong> the users, not <strong>Delete and Forget</strong>.</aside>
      </li>
    </ol>
