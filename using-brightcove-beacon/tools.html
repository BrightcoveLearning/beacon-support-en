        <h2 id="Tools">Introducing the Tools</h2>
        <p>
            In Brightcove Beacon the <strong>wrench</strong> icon (labeled 1)
            represents a set of tools. The options for the tools are
            <strong>Ingestion</strong> and <strong>Cache</strong> (2). This document
            explores the two options.

        <h2 id="Ingestion">Ingestion</h2>
        <p>In the Ingestion group you have three tools:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Update Brightcove Videos</strong>: If you have added videos to
                your Video Cloud catalog, or altered existing videos, this button syncs
                the newly added or updated videos to Brightcove Beacon.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Update Brightcove Playlists</strong>: If you have added
                playlists to your Video Cloud catalog, or altered existing playlists,
                this button syncs the newly added or updated playlists to Brightcove
                Beacon.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>XML EPG - Fetch XML from Folder</strong>: When your EPG
                (Electronic Program Guide) needs to be updated, this button retrieves
                the updated XML file. You will be provided an S3 account in which to
                drop the file.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--tip language-editable">
            You can also work with Brightcove support personnel to create a schedule
            to automatically perform ingestion.

        <h3>Caveats for ingestion</h3>
        <p>
            Note that not all data that is entered about a particular video in Studio
            is automatically ingested into Brightcove Beacon. For instance, the
            following are not ingested into Brightcove Beacon from Video Cloud:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Availability times</strong>: Scheduling times set in the
                <em>AVAILABILITY</em> section of the video's properties are not ingested
                into Brightcove Beacon. The dates will be, but not the times.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Geo Filtering</strong>: Geo filtering information set in the
                <em>AVAILABILITY</em> section of the video's properties are not ingested
                into Brightcove Beacon.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--tip language-editable">
            The issues listed above can be remedied by creating a
            <strong>Package</strong> in Brightcove Beacon the assigning the video to
            that package at ingestion via custom fields. See the
            <a href="/using-brightcove-beacon/creating-subscription-package.html">Creating a Subscription Package
            </a>
            and
            <a href="/using-brightcove-beacon/using-subscription-package.html">Using a Subscription Package
            </a>
            documents for further information.
        </aside>
        <p>
            Also note that not every field mentioned in Brightcove Beacon has an
            associated custom field. For instance
            <em>Production Country</em> and <em>Sub-Genre</em> do not have
            corresponding custom fields associated with them.
        </p>

    <section class="bcls-section">
        <h2 id="Cache">Cache</h2>
        <p>In the Cache group you have two tools:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Cache Purge</strong>: When you make changes in Brightcove
                Beacon, click this button to roll those changes into the current
                configuration. This option pulls all changes EXCEPT images into the
                current configuration.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Image Cache</strong>: If you update any images in Brightcove
                Beacon, click this button to roll the image changes into the current
                configuration.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <figure class="bcls-figure">
            <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/using-bcb/tools/cache.png" alt="cache" />
        </figure>
        <p>This process should not be done indiscriminately as doing this too frequently in production has an adverse effect on scalability and performance.</p>
