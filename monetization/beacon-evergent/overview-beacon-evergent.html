    <dl>
      <dt>Business Unit</dt>
      <dd>A Business Unit (BU) is an entity in Evergent’s system that defines a country or region where you would like to sell your content. You will need separate Business Units if you want different currencies or tax collections per country/region. In Evergent’s system each Business Unit will have a currency assigned to it; this currency is what will be presented to their users when they check out.</dd>
      <dt>Payment Gateway</dt>
      <dd>A service that allows a merchant to accept payments from customers. The payment gateway acts as an intermediary by moving the money from the bank accounts of your customers to your own bank account in a secure and reliable way.</dd>
      <dt>Merchant of Record</dt>
      <dd>The legal entity that is authorized to receive payments from consumers. You will be a MOR (Merchant of Record) with each gateway that you use.</dd>
      <dt>Merchant Account</dt>
      <dd>A virtual bank account where revenue from online sales is sent. Revenue resides in your merchant account until settlement — the process of transferring funds to your bank account. Typically, the payment gateway provides a merchant account. Gateways that do not provide merchant accounts transfer funds directly to your bank account.</dd>
      <dt>Package</dt>
      <dd>A Package defines how users can purchase access to your content in the Beacon CMS; it defines all the details for a monetization plan. It includes information such as the price, billing frequency, availability, app stores availability, currency, trial period, etc.</dd>
      <dt>Products</dt>
      <dd>Products in Evergent defines all the details for a monetization plan. It includes information such as the price, billing frequency, availability, app stores availability, currency, trial period, etc.</dd>

    <h3>What's needed:</h3>
    <h4>Beacon</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>In Beacon, you need a CMS with Evergent configured as a Store.</li>
      <li>All the countries where your services will be available.</li>
      <li>Each country should have a currency defined for receiving payments from a viewer. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Evergent</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>You need Business Units created in Evergent that map to the currencies that you want to receive payments in. </li>
      <li>Each Business Unit will have gateways and app store billing (Apple Store, Roku, Amazon, Google Play) configured. You are required to have a relationship and merchant account with each gateway they want to use.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="package_product_management">Package/Product management</h2>
    <p>You will set up and manage monetization plans from both the Beacon UI and Evergent UI. Plans will need to be manually linked using SKUs in both Beacon and Evergent:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Packages that are configured in Beacon are how information gets presented to the viewers in the app. See <a href="/using-brightcove-beacon/creating-svod-plan.html">Creating an SVOD Plan</a> for details.</li>
      <li>The <strong>Product</strong> in Evergent allows them to process payments for the correct monetization plan and validate the receipt before the viewer is granted access to the content. See <a href="/monetization/beacon-evergent/evergent-account-management.html">Evergent Account Management</a> for details.</li>
      <li>
        For the initial release, Beacon will support the following monetization models:
        <ul>
          <li>MixedVOD - subscription for authenticated users with ads served</li>
          <li>SVOD - subscription for authenticated users and no ads served</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Future releases will include TVOD and PPV.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="website_sales">Website sales</h2>
    <p>Once Packages and Products are configured, you will be able to accept payments on your Beacon Web app. Purchases in the Beacon web app are processed through a payment gateway connected through the Evergent platform.</p>
    <h3>Payment gateways and payment methods</h3>
    <p>Evergent allows our customers to receive payments through multiple payment gateways. The payment gateway configuration is at the Business Unit level. A customer can have multiple payment gateways configured to a Business Unit. When multiple gateways are configured, the viewer has different payment method options when checking out. Customers are required to have a relationship directly with the payment gateway.</p>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="In_app_purchases">In-app purchases</h2>
    <p>Beacon customers will also be able to sell their content through Apple, Google, Amazon, and Roku stores. Each store is configured as an option in the Beacon CMS and in Evergent’s system.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When <a href="/using-brightcove-beacon/creating-svod-plan.html">creating a SVOD Package in Beacon</a>, customers have the option to select which app stores they want to sell their Package through. The can set the app store, availability, location, price, currency and app store product SKU.</li>
      <li>In addition, the app store (Apple, Google, Amazon, Roku), app store Product ID, and Product Name can be configured on a SVOD Product.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="Subscriber_viewer_management">Subscriber/viewer management</h2>
    <p>The Beacon Advanced Monetization supports registration and purchase workflows through both apps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When viewers register in the Beacon app, a shadow viewer is automatically created in Evergent’s viewer database. </li>
      <li>Viewers are segmented in Evergent’s viewer database. If a customer has more than one Business Unit, viewers are created in the Business Unit that corresponds to their location.</li>
      <li>Viewers can either be non-paying viewers or paying viewers in Evergent’s system.</li>
    </ul>
