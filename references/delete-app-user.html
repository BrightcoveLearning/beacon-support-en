    <p>App users create their own accounts when they first go into a Brightcove Beacon app. You delete users when no longer needed in Beacon Classic.</p>
    <p>When deleting, you have two options, those being:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Delete</li>
      <li>Delete and Forget</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you <strong>Delete</strong>, you can later restore the user from a deleted user list. When you <strong>Delete and Forget</strong> you have no chance to restore that user.</p>
